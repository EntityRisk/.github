**EntityRisk** was founded by three health economists — bringing together decades of academic and industry experience — to unlock financial innovation in the way new medicines are brought to patients. **EntityRisk** is building a proprietary algorithmic platform to better estimate individual benefits of treatment — through advanced modeling techniques and integrated clinical trial, genomic, and real-world data. Our growing, world-class team of economists, data scientists, software engineers, finance professionals, and cutting-edge academic experts is building the tools needed to enable financial innovation in healthcare, some of which include:

- Analysis of all current and potential surrogate measures and their connections to critical endpoints of value to patients and payers
- Customized individual subpopulation-level survival and treatment duration curves
- Scenario planning for pipeline and inline assets
- Proprietary event and cash flow forecasting and analytics for efficacy-linked instruments
- Value modeling

All of our models are specifically designed to identify risk characteristics and correlations across therapeutic interventions, enabling entirely new value-based payment and performance guarantees that span the financial and life sciences sectors.
